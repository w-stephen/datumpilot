# DatumPilot

Documentation and planning materials for the DatumPilot GD&T feature control frame builder/interpreter.

## Structure
- `docs/`: product alignment, user stories, UX flows, roadmap, and architecture overview.
- `Planning/`: PRDs, prompt packs, and notes (large standards PDF left out via `.gitignore`; add it manually if you have rights to publish it).

## Usage
- Review the docs in order (`01`–`05`) to understand the vision, flows, and architecture.
- Use this repo as the single source for product requirements while implementation assets live elsewhere.
