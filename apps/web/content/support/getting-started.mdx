# Getting Started with DatumPilot

## What is DatumPilot?

DatumPilot is a web-based application for building GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing) Feature Control Frames and performing tolerance stack-up analysis. The platform validates your inputs against ASME Y14.5-2018 standards in real-time, catching errors before they reach your drawings.

DatumPilot serves mechanical engineers, quality engineers, manufacturing engineers, and design engineers across automotive, aerospace, medical device, and general manufacturing industries. Whether you're defining part tolerances or analyzing assembly stack-ups, DatumPilot streamlines workflows that traditionally require manual calculations or expensive CAD add-ons.

## Creating Your Account

### Sign Up Options

DatumPilot offers multiple ways to create an account:

- **Google OAuth**: Sign in with your Google account for one-click access
- **GitHub OAuth**: Connect with your GitHub credentials
- **Magic Link**: Enter your email address to receive a passwordless login link

{/* Screenshot: signup-options.png */}
{/* Alt: Sign up page showing Google, GitHub, and magic link options */}

### First Login

After signing up:

1. You'll receive a verification email if using magic link authentication
2. Click the verification link to confirm your email address
3. On first login, you'll land on your Dashboard with a welcome message
4. Your account starts on the **Free** plan with full access to core features

## Understanding the Dashboard

The Dashboard is your central hub for managing GD&T work.

{/* Screenshot: dashboard-overview.png */}
{/* Alt: Dashboard showing projects list, quick actions, and recent activity */}

### Projects Overview

Projects organize your FCFs and stack-up analyses into logical groups. Each project card displays:

- Project name and description
- Count of FCFs and stack-ups contained
- Last modified date
- Quick access to open or edit

### Quick Actions

The top of your Dashboard provides shortcuts:

- **New FCF**: Jump directly to the FCF Builder
- **New Stack-up**: Start a tolerance stack-up analysis
- **New Project**: Create a project to organize your work

### Recent Activity

The activity feed shows your latest actions:

- FCFs created or modified
- Stack-up analyses run
- Projects updated

### Navigation Sidebar

Access all application areas from the sidebar:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview of projects and recent activity |
| **FCF Builder** | Create and edit Feature Control Frames |
| **Stack-up Analysis** | Perform tolerance stack-up calculations |
| **Projects** | Manage all your projects |
| **Settings** | Account preferences, billing, and display options |

## Your First Project

### Why Use Projects?

Projects group related FCFs and stack-up analyses together. Common project structures include:

- One project per part (all FCFs for a single component)
- One project per assembly (all analyses for a system)
- One project per drawing revision (version tracking)

### Creating a Project

1. Click **New Project** from the Dashboard or Projects page
2. Enter a **Project Name** (e.g., "Housing Assembly Rev C")
3. Add an optional **Description** explaining the project scope
4. Click **Create Project**

{/* Screenshot: create-project-dialog.png */}
{/* Alt: New project dialog with name and description fields */}

Your project is now ready to contain FCFs and stack-up analyses.

## Quick Start: Build Your First FCF

Follow these steps to create your first Feature Control Frame:

### Step 1: Navigate to FCF Builder

Click **FCF Builder** in the sidebar or use the **New FCF** quick action.

{/* Screenshot: fcf-builder-empty.png */}
{/* Alt: FCF Builder interface with characteristic selection grid */}

### Step 2: Select a Characteristic

Click on a GD&T characteristic symbol. For this example, select **Position** (the most common tolerance type).

The builder updates to show options specific to Position tolerances.

### Step 3: Set Tolerance Value

Enter your tolerance value in the **Tolerance** field. For example: `0.25`

The unit (mm or inch) follows your account settings.

### Step 4: Add Datum References

Position requires at least one datum reference:

1. Select your **Primary Datum** (e.g., "A")
2. Optionally add **Secondary** and **Tertiary** datums
3. Set material boundary modifiers if applicable (MMB, LMB, or RFS)

### Step 5: Preview the FCF

The live preview panel shows your Feature Control Frame as it will appear on a drawing. Verify:

- Correct characteristic symbol
- Proper tolerance value and any diameter symbol
- Datum references in the right order
- No validation errors (shown in red)

{/* Alt: FCF Builder showing completed Position FCF with live preview */}

### Step 6: Save to Project

1. Click **Save FCF**
2. Select the destination project (or create a new one)
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Mounting Hole Position")
4. Click **Save**

Your FCF is now stored and can be exported or edited later.

## Understanding Your Plan

### Free Plan

Your Free account includes:

- **2 Projects** to organize your work
- **10 FCFs** for Feature Control Frame definitions
- **5 Stack-ups** for tolerance analysis
- **Text/JSON Export** for data portability

Free accounts have access to all builder features, real-time validation, and calculation engines.

### When to Upgrade

Consider upgrading to **Pro** ($29/month) when you need:

- **Visual Exports**: PNG, SVG, and PDF formats for drawings and reports
- **AI Explanations**: Plain-language interpretation of your FCFs
- **More Capacity**: 20 projects, 500 FCFs, 100 stack-ups

**Team** ($99/month) adds unlimited capacity, team collaboration features, and priority support.

To manage your subscription, go to **Settings > Billing**.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **Create a project** for your current work
2. **Build a few FCFs** to get comfortable with the builder
3. **Try a stack-up analysis** on an assembly you're designing
4. **Explore Settings** to customize units and display preferences
