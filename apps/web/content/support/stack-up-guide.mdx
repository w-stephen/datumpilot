# Stack-up Analysis Guide

## What is Tolerance Stack-up Analysis?

Tolerance stack-up analysis predicts how individual part tolerances combine to affect assembly dimensions. When multiple toleranced features contribute to a gap, clearance, or critical dimension, their variations accumulate—sometimes in ways that cause assembly problems.

### Why It Matters

Stack-up analysis answers critical questions:

- Will these parts always assemble?
- What's the worst-case gap or interference?
- Which tolerances contribute most to variation?
- Can we loosen tolerances without risking failure?

### Common Applications

| Application | Question Answered |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Gap Analysis** | What's the minimum/maximum gap between parts? |
| **Interference Check** | Will parts interfere at tolerance extremes? |
| **Clearance Verification** | Is there enough clearance for fasteners/seals? |
| **Critical Dimension** | Will the assembly meet spec? |

## Analysis Methods Explained

DatumPilot supports three analysis methods. Each balances conservatism against practicality.

### Worst-Case (Arithmetic)

The Worst-Case method assumes all tolerances simultaneously reach their extreme values.

**How it works**: Tolerances are added arithmetically. If you have three tolerances of ±0.1, the total is ±0.3.

**Result**: Guarantees 100% assembly success if parts are within tolerance.

**When to use**:
- Safety-critical assemblies (aerospace, medical, automotive safety)
- Low-volume production where statistical assumptions don't apply
- Few contributors (typically 4 or fewer dimensions)
- Customer requirements specify worst-case analysis

**Trade-off**: Most conservative method. May force unnecessarily tight tolerances on individual parts.

### RSS (Root Sum Square)

The RSS method assumes tolerances follow normal distributions and combines them statistically.

**How it works**: Tolerances are squared, summed, and square-rooted. For three tolerances of ±0.1: √(0.1² + 0.1² + 0.1²) = ±0.173.

**Result**: Approximately 99.73% assembly success (3-sigma).

**When to use**:
- High-volume production with stable processes
- Assemblies with many contributors (>4 dimensions)
- Manufacturing processes known to be normally distributed
- Cost-sensitive designs where worst-case is overly conservative

**Benefit**: Typically allows 30-40% looser tolerances than worst-case for assemblies with many contributors.

### Six Sigma

The Six Sigma method uses actual process capability data (Cp/Cpk values) for each dimension.

**How it works**: Each dimension's contribution is weighted by its process capability. Better-controlled processes contribute less variation.

**Result**: Most realistic prediction when process data is available.

**When to use**:
- Complex assemblies with known manufacturing data
- Process improvement initiatives
- Supplier quality analysis
- Mature production environments with Cp/Cpk data

**Input required**: Process capability values (Cp or Cpk) for each dimension.

### Method Comparison Summary

| Method | Confidence | Tolerance Impact | Data Required |
|--------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| Worst-Case | 100% | Tightest | None |
| RSS | ~99.73% | ~30% looser | None |
| Six Sigma | Customizable | Most realistic | Process capability |

## Creating a Stack-up Analysis

Follow these steps to set up a tolerance stack-up.

{/* Screenshot: new-stackup-dialog.png */}
{/* Alt: New stack-up analysis creation dialog */}

### Step 1: Name and Describe

Give your analysis a clear name and description:

- **Name**: "Housing-to-Cover Gap Analysis"
- **Description**: "Verifies seal gap at interface remains within 0.5-1.5mm"

Good descriptions help when revisiting analyses months later.

### Step 2: Define Measurement Objective

Specify what dimension you're analyzing:

- The closing dimension (gap, clearance, or critical measurement)
- What you're measuring: distance between two surfaces, clearance around a fastener, etc.

### Step 3: Set Acceptance Criteria

Define pass/fail limits:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Minimum** | Lower acceptable limit | 0.5 mm (minimum gap for seal) |
| **Maximum** | Upper acceptable limit | 1.5 mm (maximum gap before rattle) |

The calculator compares results against these limits.

### Step 4: Choose Positive Direction

Select the direction convention for your loop:

| Option | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| **Left-to-right** | Horizontal loops, measuring rightward |
| **Right-to-left** | Horizontal loops, measuring leftward |
| **Bottom-to-top** | Vertical loops, measuring upward |
| **Top-to-bottom** | Vertical loops, measuring downward |

This sets context for sign assignment.

### Step 5: Select Analysis Method

Choose Worst-Case, RSS, or Six Sigma based on your requirements (see [Analysis Methods](#analysis-methods-explained)).

### Step 6: Choose Units

Select mm or inch. All dimensions must use the same unit.

**Note**: Unit conversions are not automatic. Enter all values in the selected unit.

## Sign Convention

Correctly assigning positive and negative signs is critical for accurate results.

{/* Screenshot: sign-convention-diagram.png */}
{/* Alt: Diagram showing positive and negative dimension assignment */}

### The Fundamental Rules

**A dimension is POSITIVE if**:
- Increasing the dimension INCREASES the closing dimension (gap)

**A dimension is NEGATIVE if**:
- Increasing the dimension DECREASES the closing dimension (gap)

### Verification Method

After assigning signs, verify your loop:

1. Sum all nominal values with their signs
2. The result should equal your expected closing dimension

**Example**:
- Part A thickness: +10.0 mm
- Gap: closing dimension
- Part B thickness: -8.0 mm
- Housing width: +20.0 mm

Sum: +10.0 - 8.0 + 20.0 = 22.0? That doesn't represent a gap.

Corrected thinking: For a gap between Part A and Part B inside a housing:
- Housing inside width: +20.0 mm (positive—increasing it increases gap)
- Part A thickness: -10.0 mm (negative—increasing it decreases gap)
- Part B thickness: -8.0 mm (negative—increasing it decreases gap)

Sum: +20.0 - 10.0 - 8.0 = 2.0 mm gap ✓

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| All dimensions positive | Grossly overestimated total | Sketch the loop first |
| Wrong sign on one dimension | Incorrect nominal | Verify sum equals expected |
| Inconsistent direction | Random errors | Pick one direction, stick with it |

## Adding Dimensions

Click **Add Dimension** to enter each contributor to your stack-up.

{/* Screenshot: add-dimension-form.png */}
{/* Alt: Dimension entry form showing all fields */}

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Descriptive identifier | "Housing Wall Thickness" |
| **Nominal** | Target dimension value | 5.000 |
| **Plus Tolerance** | Upper deviation from nominal | 0.100 |
| **Minus Tolerance** | Lower deviation from nominal | 0.050 |
| **Sign** | Positive (+) or Negative (-) | + |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Sensitivity Coefficient** | Multiplier for contribution (default 1.0) | Lever arms, angle effects |
| **Process Capability (Cp)** | Manufacturing capability | Six Sigma method only |
| **Source Drawing** | Drawing number for traceability | Documentation requirements |
| **Revision** | Drawing revision level | Change control |

### Tolerance Entry Tips

**Symmetric tolerances** (±0.1):
- Plus Tolerance: 0.1
- Minus Tolerance: 0.1

**Asymmetric tolerances** (+0.025/-0.000):
- Plus Tolerance: 0.025
- Minus Tolerance: 0.000

**One-sided tolerances** (+0.1/-0.0):
- Plus Tolerance: 0.1
- Minus Tolerance: 0.0

### Dimension Limits

- **Minimum**: 2 dimensions required for meaningful analysis
- **Maximum**: 50 dimensions per analysis

## Understanding Results

After entering dimensions and running analysis, the results panel shows:

{/* Screenshot: stackup-results-panel.png */}
{/* Alt: Results panel showing nominal, tolerance, max, min, and pass/fail status */}

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Nominal Result** | Sum of signed nominals | Σ(sign × nominal) |
| **Total Tolerance** | Combined tolerance per method | Method-dependent |
| **Maximum Value** | Upper bound of closing dimension | Nominal + Tolerance |
| **Minimum Value** | Lower bound of closing dimension | Nominal - Tolerance |

### Pass/Fail Determination

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PASS** | Max ≤ Upper Limit AND Min ≥ Lower Limit |
| **FAIL** | Max > Upper Limit OR Min < Lower Limit |

### Margin Analysis

| Margin | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Upper Margin** | Upper Limit - Maximum | Positive = room to spare |
| **Lower Margin** | Minimum - Lower Limit | Positive = room to spare |

Negative margins indicate how much the design exceeds limits.

## Contribution Analysis

The contribution chart shows which dimensions drive the most variation.

{/* Screenshot: contribution-chart.png */}
{/* Alt: Pareto chart showing dimension contributions to total tolerance */}

### Reading the Chart

- **Bar height**: Percentage contribution to total tolerance
- **Sort order**: Largest contributors first (Pareto order)
- **Cumulative line**: Running total of contributions

### The Pareto Principle

Typically, ~80% of variation comes from ~20% of dimensions. Focus improvement efforts on the largest contributors.

### Using Contribution Data

| Contribution | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| >30% single dimension | Prime candidate for tolerance tightening |
| Many small contributors | Statistical methods (RSS) appropriate |
| One dominant contributor | May need design change, not just tolerance |

### Contribution Calculation

For Worst-Case:
```
Contribution % = (dimension tolerance / total tolerance) × 100
```

For RSS:
```
Contribution % = (dimension tolerance² / total tolerance²) × 100
```

## Comparing Methods

Run the same analysis with different methods to inform design decisions.

{/* Screenshot: method-comparison.png */}
{/* Alt: Side-by-side comparison of Worst-Case, RSS, and Six Sigma results */}

### Why Compare?

| Scenario | Insight Gained |
|----------|----------------|
| RSS passes, Worst-Case fails | Design is marginal—consider safety factor |
| Large difference between methods | Many contributors present |
| Six Sigma tighter than RSS | Process capability issues |

### Decision Framework

1. **Start with RSS** for initial design feasibility
2. **Check Worst-Case** for safety-critical features
3. **Use Six Sigma** when production process data is available

### Method Selection Guide

| Number of Contributors | Recommended Starting Method |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 2-4 | Worst-Case (statistical benefit minimal) |
| 5-10 | RSS (statistical benefit significant) |
| >10 | RSS or Six Sigma |

## Working with Asymmetric Tolerances

Many real-world tolerances are asymmetric (e.g., +0.025/-0.000).

### How DatumPilot Handles Asymmetric Tolerances

1. **Mean Shift**: The calculator adjusts the nominal to the mean of the tolerance zone
2. **Half-Tolerance**: Uses half the total range for statistical calculations

**Example**: 50.000 +0.025/-0.000
- Total range: 0.025
- Mean shift: +0.0125 from nominal
- Adjusted nominal: 50.0125
- Half-tolerance for RSS: 0.0125

### When Asymmetric Tolerances Occur

| Application | Common Asymmetry |
|-------------|------------------|
| Clearance fits | +tolerance/-0 (ensure minimum clearance) |
| Interference fits | +0/-tolerance (ensure minimum interference) |
| Critical minimums | +tolerance/-0 (guarantee minimum) |
| Critical maximums | +0/-tolerance (guarantee maximum) |

## Best Practices

### Before You Start

**Sketch your loop** before entering dimensions:

1. Draw the physical arrangement
2. Identify start and end points
3. Mark each contributing dimension
4. Assign signs based on direction
5. Verify loop closure

{/* Screenshot: loop-sketch-example.png */}
{/* Alt: Hand-sketched tolerance loop with dimensions marked */}

### During Entry

**Double-check sign convention**:
- Does increasing this dimension increase or decrease the gap?
- Does the sum of nominals equal expected closing dimension?

**Include all contributors**:
- Don't forget assembly gaps (e.g., weld gaps, adhesive thickness)
- Consider thermal expansion if applicable
- Include measurement uncertainty if significant

**Document sources**:
- Record drawing numbers and revisions
- Note assumption basis for estimated tolerances

### After Analysis

**Start conservative**:
- Begin with Worst-Case to understand maximum risk
- Relax to RSS only if Worst-Case fails and volume justifies statistical approach

**Address largest contributors first**:
- Tighten tolerances on top 2-3 contributors
- Consider design changes if tolerances are already tight

**Re-run after changes**:
- Verify improvements achieve desired result
- Check that tightened tolerances are manufacturable

## Troubleshooting

### Nominal Doesn't Match Expected

**Symptom**: Calculated nominal ≠ measured/expected closing dimension

**Causes**:
1. Sign convention error on one or more dimensions
2. Missing dimension in the loop
3. Extra dimension included that shouldn't be

**Solution**: Sketch the loop and trace each dimension, verifying signs.

### All Tolerances Show Equal Contribution

**Symptom**: Contribution chart shows nearly equal bars

**Causes**:
1. All input tolerances are identical
2. Fewer than 4 dimensions (limited Pareto effect)

**Solution**: This may be correct. Verify input tolerances match drawing specifications.

### Method Comparison Shows Huge Difference

**Symptom**: RSS result is dramatically smaller than Worst-Case

**Cause**: This is normal for analyses with many contributors. RSS benefit increases with contributor count.

**Reference**:
| Contributors | RSS / Worst-Case Ratio |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 4 | ~50% |
| 9 | ~33% |
| 16 | ~25% |
| 25 | ~20% |

### Six Sigma Results Worse Than RSS

**Symptom**: Six Sigma predicts more variation than RSS

**Cause**: Process capability values indicate poor process control (Cp < 1.33)

**Solution**: Either improve manufacturing processes or use actual capability data. Don't default Cp values to 1.0 if processes are better.

### Negative Minimum Result

**Symptom**: Minimum value is negative (indicating interference)

**Cause**: Design doesn't maintain positive gap at tolerance extremes

**Solution**: Either tighten contributing tolerances or adjust nominal dimensions to increase base gap.
