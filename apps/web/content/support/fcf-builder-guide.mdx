# FCF Builder Guide

## Overview

The FCF Builder creates Feature Control Frames (FCFs) through a guided, form-based interface. Unlike traditional CAD dialogs that require memorizing symbol sequences, DatumPilot presents options contextually based on your selections and validates against ASME Y14.5-2018 rules in real-time.

{/* Screenshot: fcf-builder-full-interface.png */}
{/* Alt: Complete FCF Builder interface showing all panels */}

### Key Benefits

- **Live Preview**: See your FCF render as you build it
- **Real-time Validation**: Catch errors before they reach drawings
- **Context-Aware Options**: Only valid choices appear based on your selections
- **Standard Compliance**: Enforces ASME Y14.5-2018 rules automatically

## Characteristic Selection

Select a geometric characteristic to begin building your FCF. Characteristics are organized by category per ASME Y14.5-2018.

{/* Screenshot: characteristic-selection-grid.png */}
{/* Alt: Grid of GD&T symbols organized by category */}

### Form Controls

Form controls constrain the shape of a feature independent of any datum reference.

| Symbol | Name | Controls |
|--------|------|----------|
| ⏤ | **Flatness** | Surface deviation from a perfect plane |
| ⏤ | **Straightness** | Line element deviation from perfectly straight |
| ○ | **Circularity** | Cross-section deviation from a perfect circle |
| ⌭ | **Cylindricity** | Surface deviation from a perfect cylinder |

**Note**: Form controls never reference datums. The builder disables datum selection when these are chosen.

### Orientation Controls

Orientation controls constrain angular relationship to datum features.

| Symbol | Name | Controls |
|--------|------|----------|
| ⟂ | **Perpendicularity** | Surface/axis deviation from 90° to datum |
| ∠ | **Angularity** | Surface/axis deviation from specified angle to datum |
| ∥ | **Parallelism** | Surface/axis deviation from parallel to datum |

**Note**: Orientation controls require at least one datum reference.

### Location Controls

Location controls constrain position relative to datum reference frame.

| Symbol | Name | Controls |
|--------|------|----------|
| ⊕ | **Position** | Feature location relative to true position |
| ◎ | **Concentricity** | Axis alignment (median points) |
| ⌯ | **Symmetry** | Median plane/axis alignment |

**Note**: Location controls require datum references. Position is the most commonly used GD&T control.

### Profile Controls

Profile controls constrain the shape of a line or surface.

| Symbol | Name | Controls |
|--------|------|----------|
| ⌒ | **Profile of a Line** | 2D cross-section shape |
| ⌓ | **Profile of a Surface** | 3D surface shape |

**Note**: Profile controls may or may not require datums depending on application.

### Runout Controls

Runout controls constrain surface variation during rotation about a datum axis.

| Symbol | Name | Controls |
|--------|------|----------|
| ↗ | **Circular Runout** | Single cross-section variation during rotation |
| ↗↗ | **Total Runout** | Entire surface variation during rotation |

**Note**: Runout controls always require a datum axis.

## Tolerance Zone Definition

After selecting a characteristic, define the tolerance zone that controls feature variation.

{/* Screenshot: tolerance-zone-panel.png */}
{/* Alt: Tolerance zone input panel showing diameter toggle and value field */}

### Diameter Symbol Toggle

The diameter symbol (⌀) indicates a cylindrical or spherical tolerance zone.

| Toggle State | Tolerance Zone Shape | Common Uses |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Off** | Parallel planes (width zone) | Surfaces, line elements |
| **On** | Cylinder or sphere | Hole axes, pin positions |

**When to Use**: Enable the diameter symbol for axis positions (holes, pins, shafts) where the tolerance zone should be cylindrical.

### Tolerance Value

Enter the total tolerance zone size in your selected unit (mm or inch).

- Numeric values only (e.g., `0.25`, `0.010`)
- The builder validates against reasonable ranges
- Unit follows your account settings (Settings > Display)

### Material Condition Modifiers

Material condition modifiers change how tolerance applies based on feature size.

| Modifier | Symbol | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **RFS** | (none) | Regardless of Feature Size—tolerance applies at any produced size |
| **MMC** | Ⓜ | Maximum Material Condition—bonus tolerance available as feature departs from MMC |
| **LMC** | Ⓛ | Least Material Condition—bonus tolerance available as feature departs from LMC |

#### When Modifiers Apply

| Characteristic | RFS | MMC | LMC |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Form (Flatness, etc.) | Default | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| Orientation | Allowed | Feature of size only | Feature of size only |
| Position | Default | Feature of size only | Feature of size only |
| Profile | Allowed | Feature of size only | Feature of size only |
| Runout | Default | Not allowed | Not allowed |

**Note**: MMC and LMC only apply to features of size (holes, pins, slots, tabs). The builder enables these options only when valid.

#### Bonus Tolerance (MMC/LMC)

When MMC or LMC is specified, the actual tolerance available depends on the produced feature size:

**MMC Example** (hole at ⌀10.0 ±0.1, position tolerance ⌀0.25 at MMC):
- At MMC (⌀9.9): Position tolerance = 0.25
- At ⌀10.0: Position tolerance = 0.25 + 0.10 = 0.35
- At LMC (⌀10.1): Position tolerance = 0.25 + 0.20 = 0.45

The DatumPilot calculator computes bonus tolerance when you provide feature size data.

## Datum Reference Frame

Datum references establish the coordinate system for measuring the controlled feature.

{/* Screenshot: datum-reference-panel.png */}
{/* Alt: Datum reference selection showing primary, secondary, tertiary fields */}

### Datum Order

Datums are referenced in order of precedence:

| Position | Name | Degrees of Freedom Constrained |
|----------|------|-------------------------------|
| 1st | **Primary** | 3 (establishes first contact plane/axis) |
| 2nd | **Secondary** | 2 (perpendicular constraint) |
| 3rd | **Tertiary** | 1 (final rotational/translational lock) |

**Important**: The order matters. `|A|B|C|` creates a different datum reference frame than `|B|A|C|`. The primary datum always constrains the most degrees of freedom.

### Selecting Datums

1. **Primary Datum** (required for most controls): Select from available datum letters (A-Z)
2. **Secondary Datum** (optional): Select a different letter
3. **Tertiary Datum** (optional): Select a third unique letter

The builder prevents selecting the same datum twice.

### Datum Material Boundary Modifiers

Like tolerance modifiers, datums can have material boundary modifiers:

| Modifier | Symbol | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **RMB** | (none) | Regardless of Material Boundary—datum established at actual surface |
| **MMB** | Ⓜ | Maximum Material Boundary—datum established at virtual condition |
| **LMB** | Ⓛ | Least Material Boundary—opposite of MMB |

**When to Use**: MMB is common when using datum features that are also features of size (e.g., a datum hole). This allows the part to shift within the datum feature simulator.

### Validation Rules

The builder enforces these datum rules:

- **No duplicates**: Each datum letter can appear only once
- **Minimum datums**: Position requires at least one; form controls require none
- **Modifier restrictions**: MMB/LMB only on datum features of size

## Feature Type Selection

Specify the type of feature being controlled to enable accurate calculations.

{/* Screenshot: feature-type-selection.png */}
{/* Alt: Feature type dropdown showing available options */}

### Available Feature Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Internal Hole** | Round hole through or into material | Clearance holes, tapped holes |
| **External Shaft** | Round protrusion from material | Pins, shafts, bosses |
| **Slot** | Elongated internal feature | Keyways, oblong holes |
| **Tab** | Elongated external feature | Keys, tabs |
| **Plane** | Flat surface | Mounting faces |
| **Boss/Pin** | Raised cylindrical feature | Locating pins |
| **Pattern** | Multiple identical features | Bolt circle, hole patterns |
| **Other** | Non-standard features | Complex geometry |

### Why Feature Type Matters

Feature type affects:

1. **MMC/LMC Calculations**: Internal features have MMC at smallest size; external at largest
2. **Bonus Tolerance**: Calculator uses feature type to determine bonus direction
3. **Interpretation**: AI explanations reference the specific feature geometry

### Pattern Count

For pattern features, specify the quantity:

- Enter the count (e.g., `4` for a 4-hole bolt circle)
- The FCF displays as "4X" prefix
- Calculations apply to each feature in the pattern

## Advanced Options

### Projected Tolerance Zone

A projected tolerance zone extends the position tolerance zone above the surface of the part.

{/* Screenshot: projected-tolerance-zone.png */}
{/* Alt: Diagram showing projected tolerance zone extending from hole */}

#### When to Use

Use projected tolerance zones when:

- Fasteners (bolts, studs) extend through the part
- Mating part alignment depends on the fastener angle, not hole position
- Interference could occur outside the controlled feature

#### Setting Up

1. Enable **Projected Tolerance Zone** toggle
2. Enter **Projection Height** (typically mating part thickness + engagement)
3. The FCF displays with the ⓟ symbol and height value

### Composite FCF

<Callout type="info">
Composite FCF functionality is planned for a future release. This allows specifying both pattern location and feature-to-feature refinement in a single frame.
</Callout>

## Live Preview

The preview panel renders your FCF in real-time as you make selections.

{/* Screenshot: live-preview-panel.png */}
{/* Alt: Live preview showing rendered FCF with validation status */}

### Reading the Preview

The preview displays:

- **Characteristic Symbol**: First compartment
- **Tolerance Zone**: Second compartment (diameter symbol if applicable, value, modifier)
- **Datum References**: Subsequent compartments in order

### Validation Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Green checkmark | FCF is valid per ASME Y14.5-2018 |
| Yellow warning | Valid but with advisory notes |
| Red error | Invalid—must fix before saving |

### Inline Messages

Validation messages appear below the preview:

- **Errors**: Must be resolved (e.g., "Position requires at least one datum reference")
- **Warnings**: Advisory only (e.g., "RFS is implicit and typically not shown")

## Validation Rules

DatumPilot validates FCFs against ASME Y14.5-2018 rules. Here are common errors and solutions.

### Error: Datum Required

**Message**: "Datum required for [characteristic]"

**Cause**: Location and orientation controls need datum references.

**Solution**: Add at least one datum reference in the Datum Reference Frame panel.

### Error: Modifier Not Allowed

**Message**: "MMC not allowed for [characteristic]"

**Cause**: Form controls (Flatness, Straightness, Circularity, Cylindricity) always apply RFS.

**Solution**: Remove the material condition modifier or select a different characteristic.

### Error: Duplicate Datum

**Message**: "Duplicate datum reference"

**Cause**: Same datum letter appears more than once.

**Solution**: Select unique datum letters for primary, secondary, and tertiary positions.

### Error: Invalid Tolerance Value

**Message**: "Tolerance must be a positive number"

**Cause**: Zero, negative, or non-numeric tolerance entered.

**Solution**: Enter a positive decimal value (e.g., `0.25`).

### Warning: Implicit RFS

**Message**: "RFS is implicit per ASME Y14.5-2018"

**Cause**: Explicitly showing RFS modifier when it's the default.

**Solution**: This is valid but unnecessary. Modern practice omits RFS symbol.

### Understanding Error Codes

Each validation message includes a code for reference:

| Code | Category |
|------|----------|
| E001-E009 | Schema validation errors |
| E010-E019 | Characteristic-specific rules |
| E020-E029 | Datum reference rules |
| E030-E039 | Modifier application rules |

## Saving and Exporting

### Save to Project

1. Click **Save FCF** when validation passes
2. Select destination project from dropdown
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Bore Position to A-B-C")

</Callout>

The AI interpreter provides plain-language explanations of your FCF.

{/* Screenshot: ai-interpretation-panel.png */}
{/* Alt: AI interpretation showing tolerance zone description and measurement guidance */}

### What You Get

1. **Tolerance Zone Description**: Physical shape and size of the acceptable zone
2. **Datum Precedence**: How each datum constrains degrees of freedom
3. **Material Condition Effects**: How MMC/LMC affects actual tolerance
4. **Measurement Setup**: Guidance for inspection planning

### Example Interpretation

For a Position FCF `⊕ | ⌀0.25 Ⓜ | A | B | C`:

> "This Feature Control Frame specifies the position of a feature of size relative to datum reference frame A-B-C. The tolerance zone is a cylinder of diameter 0.25mm at Maximum Material Condition.
>
> **Bonus Tolerance**: As the feature departs from MMC, additional tolerance becomes available equal to the departure amount.
>
> **Datum A** (primary): Establishes the first contact plane, constraining 3 degrees of freedom.
> **Datum B** (secondary): Provides perpendicular constraint, constraining 2 additional degrees of freedom.
> **Datum C** (tertiary): Locks the final degree of freedom for complete part orientation."

## Tips and Best Practices

### Start with the Characteristic

Begin every FCF by selecting the geometric characteristic. This:

- Enables appropriate options automatically
- Prevents invalid modifier selections
- Sets context for datum requirements

### Use Accurate Feature Types

Select the feature type that matches your geometry:

- Enables correct MMC/LMC calculations
- Improves AI interpretation accuracy
- Produces better documentation

### Review Warnings Before Export

Warnings don't prevent saving, but review them:

- Some indicate potential drawing review issues
- Others suggest standard practice improvements

### Name FCFs Descriptively

Good names make projects manageable:

- ✓ "Mounting Hole Position to A-B-C"
- ✓ "Bore Perpendicularity to Datum A"
- ✗ "FCF 1"
- ✗ "Position"

### Use Projects Consistently

Organize FCFs logically:

- One project per part or assembly
- Group related FCFs together
- Include revision identifiers when needed
